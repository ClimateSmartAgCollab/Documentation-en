## Contribute to Documentation

The minimal GitHub skills to contribute to Documentation are found in [GitHub help](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/github/) and [GitHub branches](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/github/branches.html). You may want to sync this repository to a local version and edit the text files there, pushing your changes back up to the repository. If you want to edit files locally, you will need to learn [GitHub Desktop](https://climatesmartagcollab.github.io/Documentation-en/github/githubdesktop.html).

Contributions should be authored in a separate branch or fork (depending on user access). When documentation is ready to be merged put in a Pull Request to merge the documentation to Main branch. The PR review and merge will be done by the Documentation manager. 

## Writing with Just the Docs

Content can be edited directly in the Documentation repository using the built in GitHub text editor. As Just the Docs has already been deployed, any who want to contribute do not need to redeploy Just the Docs, contributers can just edit the text files and directories of the `docs` folder which stores the content. 

To write content you can reference the [UI components of Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/ui-components/), especially typography (for headings), tables, lists and callouts.

Documentation is stored in the `docs` directory. Subdirectories store parent/child topics (like Data_Documentation). Pictures are stored in `docs/assets/images`.
