To evolve towards a federated data future, an extra "applied ontology" framework layer has to be added which essentially attempts to externalise as much of the language a database uses as possible, enabling it to join a larger semantically interoperable community of datasets.  Other benefits accrue - database development personnel become acquainted with a 3rd party standardised vocabulary rather than doing the work to unwittingly maintain a mirrored semblance of one.  We begin with a short discussion of what applied ontologies are, how they differ from simpler kinds of standardised vocabulary, and why certain features of them are needed to achieve a federated data future.  We then cover training resources about how to locate and reuse ontologies in study metadata and data. 

* Unique, globally resolvable identifiers to source ontology, definition, and synonymy.
* Hierarchic terms
* No term deletion, only deprecation and replacement
* Ontology picklists are familiar to computer science developers as lookup tables
* Multilingual (also by way of synonymy lookup tables)
* Object properties (relations between objects)
