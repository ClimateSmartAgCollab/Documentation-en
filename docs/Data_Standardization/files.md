## Why standardize file names?

Standardizing file naming conventions helps researchers better organize their own work and collaborate with others. 
Benefits include: 
* Consistent structure across files, making it easier for researchers to locate and identify documents.
* Uniform file names make it easier to sort and arrange files in alphabetical or chronological order. 
* Promotes a shared understanding of how files are named and organized.
* version numbers or dates in file names helps manage version control effectively.

## Data Management Plans

All research projects for the Genome Canada's Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems Initiative have created a [Data Management Plan (DMP)](../datamanagementplan.md) using the [DMP Assistant of Portage](https://dmp-pgd.ca/). This DMP typically includes recommended file naming protocols for each research project.
