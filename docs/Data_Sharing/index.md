# Data Sharing

Satisfying FAIR data management principles for data sharing involves several administrative and technical parts including hosting data, providing access permission, and enabling discovery of that data. This service needs to be maintained beyond the life of the project.

Administrative:

* Identifying a person or team responsible for managing project data storage and access.
* Making clear how project data may be used and what attribution is required, if any.  This should be covered in data licensing and governance documentation.
* Identify contact role(s) and processes within an organization for handling access requests.
  
Hosting:

* Determining a public or access-controlled repository to host project data.
  * [Borealis](https://borealisdata.ca/), the Canadian Dataverse Repository (previously called Dataverse).  See [Data Sharing using Borealis](https://learn.scholarsportal.info/modules/portage/dataverse-101-module-1/) for an introduction to data sharing and the Borealis platform.
* Ensuring Secure (tamperproof) upload and download of data.
* Implementing and maintaining access control as necessary.

Data Discovery:

* Utilizing FAIR data catalogues to enable researchers to become aware of project datasets in terms of available data types, fields, size of content, and even experimental designs that lead to the content. Providing this information usually benefits from dataset scheme and standardization work.
