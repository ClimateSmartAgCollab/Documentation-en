There are many places to find structured vocabularies such as ontologies and taxonomies as a source for terms.

- The organization CGIAR has published a resource of common [Ontologies for agriculture](https://bigdata.cgiar.org/ontologies-for-agriculture/).
- [AgroPortal](https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/) is another source of agriculture research vocabulary.
- The above resources relay a number of [OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) life science ontologies related to agriculture, biology, climate, and ecology research, as detailed in the [ontology](https://github.com/ClimateSmartAgCollab/Documentation-en/blob/main/docs/Data_Standardization/ontology.md) documentation section.
