There are many places to find structured vocabularies such as ontologies and taxonomies as a source for terms.

- The organization CGIAR has published a resource of common [Ontologies for agriculture](https://bigdata.cgiar.org/ontologies-for-agriculture/).
- [AgroPortal](https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/) is another source of semantic artefacts.
